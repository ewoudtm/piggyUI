## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3001
```

## Play
Goal of the game is to reach 100 points first. 
During your turn you roll a dice, 
 - on a 2 - 6 these points are added to your roundtotal
 - then you decide to roll again or cash your roundtotal to your gametotal, giving the round to your opponent
 - if you roll a 1 you loose your roundtotal and pass the round to your opponent.
 
 
 ## Work in Progress
 - add rule to give turn to opponent on a roll of 1
 - only allow current player to cash points
